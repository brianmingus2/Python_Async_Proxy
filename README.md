A solution to the C10K problem in Pure Python.

This is an HTTP/HTTPS CONNECT proxy written in async Python, which has been Cythonized.

## System Tuning

In order to run the C10K benchmark on Linux you may need to increase the number of allowed file handles. There are a variety of other ways to tune the system as well.

## Benchmark Environment

For benchmarking purposes a tuned local Apache webserver was used as the backend. It served the small index.html included in this repo from `/var/www/html/`.

## Installation

- The Python distribution used was Miniforge. https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge

- After installing Miniforge, run `mamba install cython`.

- If building Python from source run `pip3 install cython setuptools`.

- If building Python from source there are compiler flags available such as `--enable-optimizations --enable-experimental-jit` which improve performance.

- To build `proxy.pyx` run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`.

- On Ubuntu, run `sudo apt update` followed by `sudo apt -y install curl wrk siege`.

## Running the Benchmark

To run the benchmark:

- Make sure Apache is serving `index.html`.
- Start the proxy with `python -c "import proxy"`.
- Run `bash bench.sh`.

## Results

The output will include the results of `wrk` and `siege`. On the test system, which is Ubuntu LTS on VMWare Workstation Pro, it gets up to 4550 requests per second, which is almost halfway to C10K.
